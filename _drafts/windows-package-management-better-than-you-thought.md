title: 'Windows Package Management: Better than You Thought'
---

Give examples of google searching how to uninstall msis and the lack of a good solution. Some of the solutions on google use gwmi win32_product to get the msi product code then call msiexec on those to uninstall. This is slow so other methods look in the registry /uninstall.

Talk about the Package Management powershell module with the msi providername.
